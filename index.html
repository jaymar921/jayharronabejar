I decided to sell my plugin and a lot of people liked and bought it, Custom Enchantments is one of my 7 developed plugins during my college life.

                <p class="card-paragraph">Our startup idea serves as an intermediary that connects vehicle owners and/or drivers to mechanics. The vehicle owner and/or driver chooses what vehicular problem they are experiencing and connects to a registered mechanic. With the help of GPS, it gets the location of the vehicle owner and/or driver that needs assistance. This startup idea will provide immediate assistance, unlike calling for a friend/family which may take a while depending on the availability of the person. With this startup idea, it will reduce the waiting time and minimize the traffic congestion caused by the vehicular problem. The difference between it and the existing application is that the service provider is not centralized. Any qualified mechanic can apply to provide service.</p>

Implemented database to store data and Email API to notify students with upcoming events such the ICT Congress and Acquaintance party.
